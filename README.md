# De_Duplicate: De-Duplicate Datasets for the Same Objects

Version: 1.1.0

Release date:  02-05-2018

Last Modified: 22-06-2018


Introduction
--------

This package is written in the C++ programming language. It is used to 
de-duplicate the datasets where there are multiple exactly same data 
objects in it. Here we implement perfect hashing (a two-level universal
hashing) for de-duplication. Now this package suppport two types of data:
integer and real values


Usage
--------

We provide a Makefile and a shell script (i.e., run.sh) as a running 
example for comipling and running the package. Before running this package, 
please ensure the input format of the dataset is correct. We give a sample 
dataset (i.e., Mnist) for your reference.
